The AI is trained using the NEAT neuroevolution algorithm, and you can read more about it here:  
https://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.cec02.pdf


You can using the training section configure the neuroevolution process and craft the best AI that will be saved locally.
If your AI beats the record of the globally best AI, it will replace it as the 'record best AI'!
