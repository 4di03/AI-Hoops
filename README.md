===========

Test of asynchronous flask communication with web page. 

This repository is a sample flask application that updates a webpage using a background thread for all users connected.
It is based on the very useful Flask-SocketIO code from Miguel Grinberg.

https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/Flask-SocketIO

To use - please clone the repository and then set up your virtual environment using the requirements.txt file with pip and virtualenv.
Start the application with:
python application.py
