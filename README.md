# Async Flask Test

===========

Test of asynchronous flask communication with web page. 

This repository is a sample flask application that updates a webpage using a background thread for all users connected.
It is based on the very useful Flask-SocketIO code from Miguel Grinberg.

https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/Flask-SocketIO

    # Activate that virtual environment
    source venv/bin/activate
    # Install the project requirements.
    pip install -r requirements.txt  #(or in Windows - sometimes python -m pip install -r requirements.txt )
